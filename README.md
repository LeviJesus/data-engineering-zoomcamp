# Data Engineering Zoomcamp

This repository contains materials, code, and projects from the Data Engineering Zoomcamp.

## Overview

This repository tracks my learning journey through data engineering concepts, tools, and best practices. The zoomcamp covers various aspects of modern data engineering, including data ingestion, processing, orchestration, and analytics.

## Topics Covered

- **Data Ingestion**: Batch and streaming data collection
- **Data Processing**: Data transformation and cleaning
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Automating data pipelines
- **Data Warehousing**: Building and managing data warehouses
- **Analytics Engineering**: dbt and data modeling
- **Batch Processing**: Large-scale data processing frameworks
- **Streaming**: Real-time data processing
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud platforms and containerization

## Technologies

The zoomcamp typically covers tools such as:
- Python
- Docker
- SQL
- Apache Spark
- Apache Kafka
- dbt
- Airflow/Prefect
- Google Cloud Platform / AWS
- Terraform
